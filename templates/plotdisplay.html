<h3>Notes about fscan plots:</h3>
<i>Frequency Range:</i> These plots are pre-generated by <a href = "https://egrove.olemiss.edu/etd/756/">fscan</a> and stored locally on the interface, meaning that all plots that come from this tool will have the same resolution of 100Hz.</br>
<i>Thresholds:</i> The threshold for coherences' inclusion in the database used by this tool is 0.15, but the fscan data that generates this plot does not have a threshold for inclusion. Thus, coherences not included in the database are present in this plot, and not all coherences seen will be included in this tool's database.
