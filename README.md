# linefinder-interface
An interface built in Flask that allows users to parse through LIGO 'line' data.

This project has been in the works since June of 2020--previous versions of the readme file are found in the archives directory.

Current README [6/11/2021]:
This directory is used to populate a SQLite database with information about gravitational wave lines gathered from the LIGO collaboration and search said database for more specificity. As of the time of writing, the search tool is a simple web page that returns a result and the database is only populated with a few files' worth of lines but supports the addition of more.

The first step to using this directory is to run init.py, which populates the database line_finder.db with line objects from files stored in the 'data' directory. It is important that, when running init.py, the correct data directory is chosen. The data directory should have subdirectories for each week of data collected that each contain .txt files for various channels. This project previously used .mat files generated by the pycoh program. It has since moved to using .txt files generated by the fscan program.

After the database is populated, app.py can be used to search it. As of the time of writing, the search tool can search five aspects of lines--the run, the frequency, the coherence, the week, and the channel. The frequency and coherence fields can be sorted by bound. Once the desired filters are added, hitting the 'search' button on the webpage will return lines matching the filters on a new page. There is no functionality on this page, so in order to run another query simply open up the page again by hitting 'back' on the browser. Users are also able to download the results in a sorted .csv file by clicking the "Download Results" link at the top of the page.

This program has reached its production version and will be available on Carleton College's Virgo server (virgo.physics.carleton.edu) in the near future. The production version of this code can be found in a separate branch (prodready), and be cloned separately. This version of the file contains a conda environment with all appropriate packages installed as a .yml file and an empty shell of the database which can be populated using init.py. The data is not present due to security reasons, but can be pulled down from the LIGO cluster using CoherenceGrab.py and MrSnippy.py, two scripts which are in main/archives in this repository.

Any bug fixes or quality of life changes necessary will be pushed as needed. If you have questions, feel free to contact us:
